#STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION OF SENIMENT ANALYSIS

1.DATA COLLECTION

The first step in sentiment analysis is collecting a dataset that contains textual data such as product reviews, tweets, comments, or feedback along with sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral). In most cases, the data is collected from sources like CSV files, APIs, or online platforms. Each data entry should ideally have at least two columns — one for the text and one for the corresponding sentiment. This labeled dataset forms the foundation for training and evaluating the sentiment classifier.

2.TEXT PREPROCESSING

Raw text data is often noisy and unstructured, making preprocessing a critical step. Preprocessing involves cleaning and standardizing the text to improve model performance. The text is first converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity. Next, special characters, punctuation, numbers, and HTML tags are removed. URLs and extra white spaces are eliminated. Regular expressions are often used for these tasks. In some cases, tokenization (breaking text into words), stop-word removal (removing words like “the”, “is”, “a”), and stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their base form) are also applied. This step ensures that the model focuses on the most relevant and clean features in the text.

3.FEATURE EXTRACTION (TEXT VECTORIZATION)

Since machine learning algorithms work with numerical data, the cleaned text needs to be converted into a numeric format. This is done using vectorization techniques. A common approach is TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which converts the collection of text documents into a matrix of numerical values. TF-IDF gives higher weight to words that are important (frequent in a document but rare in others), allowing the model to focus on meaningful terms. This step transforms textual reviews into a form suitable for model input.

4.SPLITTING THE DATASET

After vectorization, the dataset is split into two subsets — a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This split is essential for preventing overfitting and understanding how the model performs on real-world data. A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

5.MODEL TRAINING

With the training data prepared, the next step is to train a machine learning model. In sentiment analysis, Logistic Regression is a popular choice for binary classification (positive or negative sentiment). The TF-IDF features are fed into the logistic regression model, which learns patterns and relationships between the input features (words or phrases) and the output labels (sentiments). The training process involves adjusting the model’s internal weights to minimize prediction errors.

6.SENTIMENT PREDICTION

Once the model has been trained, it is used to predict sentiments for the test dataset. The trained model takes the TF-IDF vectorized test data and outputs a predicted sentiment label for each review. These predictions simulate how the model would perform in a real-world deployment, helping assess its practical utility.

7.MODEL EVALUATION

Model evaluation is done by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels in the test data. Common evaluation metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and the Confusion Matrix. Accuracy gives the percentage of correctly predicted sentiments. Precision measures how many predicted positives were truly positive, while recall indicates how many actual positives were correctly predicted. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, offering deeper insight into the model’s strengths and weaknesses.

8.FINAL OUTPUT AND INTERPRETATION

The final output of sentiment analysis includes the predicted sentiment for each test instance, along with a report summarizing the model’s performance metrics. If the accuracy and other evaluation scores are high, the model can be deployed to analyze real-time sentiment from new reviews. The interpretation of the model helps businesses and researchers understand customer opinions, improve services, and make data-driven decisions.
